# Image-to-Image and Image-to-Tag Framework

This project is a framework for training image-to-image and image-to-tag models using TensorFlow. It provides a modular structure for defining and training various types of neural networks.

## Installation

1.  **Install TensorFlow:**
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow
    ```

2.  **Install other dependencies:**
    Based on the project structure, you might need the following libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy
    ```
    The project also seems to use a custom library named `Rignak`. Installation instructions for `Rignak` should be provided separately if it's a custom package. If it's part of this repository, ensure it's correctly added to the Python path.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories:

-   **`src/trainers`**: Contains scripts and classes for training models.
    -   `src/trainers/image_to_image_trainers/run/`: Example scripts for running image-to-image model training.
    -   `src/trainers/image_to_tag_trainers/run/`: Example scripts for running image-to-tag model training.
-   **`src/models`**: Defines the neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net, Autoencoders, Classifiers).
-   **`src/generators`**: Provides data generators for feeding data to the models during training.
-   **`src/callbacks`**: Includes custom callbacks for Keras training loops (e.g., for plotting, logging history).
-   **`src/losses`**: Defines custom loss functions.
-   **`src/modules`**: Contains reusable building blocks for models (e.g., convolutional blocks, custom layers).
-   **`src/samples`**: Likely contains sample data or scripts to generate sample data for testing or demonstration.
-   **`src/scripts`**: Utility scripts for various tasks like data preprocessing or model conversion.
-   **`src/output_spaces`**: Manages the definition of output spaces for tasks like classification or regression.

## Basic Usage

To train a model, you would typically run one of the scripts found in the `src/trainers/image_to_image_trainers/run/` or `src/trainers/image_to_tag_trainers/run/` directories.

For example, to run an image-to-image training script:
```bash
python src/trainers/image_to_image_trainers/run/your_training_script.py --your_arguments
```

Replace `your_training_script.py` with the specific script you want to run and `--your_arguments` with the required command-line arguments for that script.

**General Training Process:**

1.  **Prepare your dataset:** Ensure your images and (if applicable) tags are in the expected format.
2.  **Configure your model and training parameters:** This might involve modifying a configuration file or directly editing the training script. This includes selecting the model architecture, generator, loss functions, and callbacks.
3.  **Run the training script:** Execute the appropriate script from the `src/trainers/.../run/` directories.
4.  **Monitor training:** Observe the logs and any plots generated by callbacks to track the training progress.
5.  **Evaluate the model:** After training, use appropriate metrics or visualization tools to assess the model's performance.

Please refer to the specific scripts within the `run` directories for more detailed examples and available command-line arguments.
